            <p>The mission will take four years to reach Psyche, where it will take photos, analyse <br> the chemical
                composition of the asteroid and measure its interior structure and <br> magnetic field. The aim is to
                figure
                out whether Psyche is an ancient planetary <br> core, determine how it formed and extend those
                inferences to
                understand terrestrial <br> planets.
